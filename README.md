# HackCMU 2023 - Space Face
*by Melody Hu, Irene Pi, and Angela Lou*

If you are a parent, you probably don't want your kids to check out and buy stuff on Amazon without your consent. But, you still want them to choose what they would like on Amazon. This is a Chrome browser extension that doesn't let anyone proceed to the checkout page until a known face (ideally, parent's face) is recognized via the web camera. Also, because HackCMU's theme this year is space, we added space helmets on everyone's faces identified on the web camera when scanning for known people :) Here are each of the components of the project in detail:

## Chrome extension
uses SteamCode Chrome Extension tutorial template to start

## Mock website

## Facial Recognition
